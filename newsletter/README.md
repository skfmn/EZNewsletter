Before you start you must create an MSSQL Database, if your not sure how ask your hosting provider.

Be sure to copy the information they give you as you will need it during installation.

Make sure you have "write" permissions on the newsletter folder. Again if your not sure how ask your hosting provider

Once you have created the Database, Upload the "newsletter" folder and all of it contents to the Root folder of your website.

Navigate to `http://{www.yourwebsite.com}/newsletter/install/install.asp`

And follow the instructions

once installation is done you can login using "admin" for both user name and password

Be sure to change your password once you login.


The newsletter.asp file contains the form for users to subscribe. It may be formatted for your website.

We can install any of the EZcodes for a fee.
If you would like some custom ASP coding done we are available and charge reasonable rates

Please contact admin@aspjunction.com
